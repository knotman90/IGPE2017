#Lesson 1.1

##Hello Classes
A class is a descrition both the **state** and the **behaviour** of an Object.
Think about the state of a traffic light. At any point what are the possible state a traffic light can be?

Do computer programs have a state? If yes what are the *variables* of a computer program state?

###Bookstore
What are getters and setters? 
Show how to automatically generate them using *eclipse*

- *Source -> Generate Getters and Setters*

```java
package BookStore;

import java.util.Date;

public class Book {
	
	private String author;
	private Date year;
	private int npages;
	private String ISBN;
	

}
```
```java
package BookStore;

public class BookStore {

	private Book[] library;

	/*number of book inserted*/
	private int size;
	/* Maximum capacity of the bookstore*/
	private int capacity;

	public BookStore(int _capacity) {
		capacity = _capacity;
		assert(capacity>0);

		library= new Book[capacity];
		size=0;
	}

	public void addBook(Book b){
		library[size] = b;
		size++;

		//short version
		//library[size++] = b;
	}

	public void removeBook(Book b){
        
	}

	public void removeBook(int b){

	}

	public void searchForBook(Book b){

	}
}
```

**How to implement the remove method?**

**What about the search method?**

##Java Basics

Java is **Object Oriented** ans so supports concepts like:

- Classes
- Objects
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
