#Collections - Part 2


##Interface


As you remember from the Lesson 3.0 the root of the *Collections* framework in Java is the `Collections` interface. Collection might support different operations

- Ordered or unordered
- Duplicates allowed 
- Immutable or mutable

Collections does not provide an implementation for each of the many type of collections. Instead it provides *subinterfaces* for subgroups of collections

- Set 
- List
- Queue (pronounced `kju`)
- Map

All general purpouse implementation have constructors that takes a `Collection` object. 


```java
 public ArrayList(Collection<? extends E> c) {
        elementData = c.toArray();
        size = elementData.length;
        // c.toArray might (incorrectly) not return Object[] (see 6260652)
        if (elementData.getClass() != Object[].class)
            elementData = Arrays.copyOf(elementData, size, Object[].class);
    }
```


```java
public HashSet(Collection<? extends E> c) {
        map = new HashMap<>(Math.max((int) (c.size()/.75f) + 1, 16));
        addAll(c);
    }
```

##Traversing a Collection
### `for-each` construct
```java
/*
for (Object o : collection)
    System.out.println(o);
    */
  Collection<Integer> collection = new TreeSet<Integer>();
		//do work on the collection
		for (Integer collection_element: collection) {
			System.out.println(collection_element);
		}
    

    
```
### Iterators (make sure you review **Iterators** on the book)

```java
for (Iterator iterator = collection.iterator(); iterator.hasNext();) {
			Integer integer = (Integer) iterator.next();
			
		}
```
Iterators abstract the concept of iteration implementing the following (simple) interface
```java
public interface Iterator<E> {
    boolean hasNext(); // returns true if the iteration has more elements,
    E next(); //returns the next element in the iteration
    void remove(); //optional, removes the last element that was returned by next
}

```
**IMPORTANT** when you need to iterate and modify the collection at the same time `Iterator`is the only way to do it withouth triggering any *undefined behavior*.
For instance imagine if you need to remove elements greater than 5 from a Collection of Integers.
One way to do it is:

```java
for (Iterator iterator = collection.iterator(); iterator.hasNext();) {
			Integer integer = (Integer) iterator.next();
			if(integer > 5)
				iterator.remove();
		}
		

```
Note that the previous example is nothing but a `filter` which can be abstracted Easily using `Collections`

```java
static void filter(Collection<?> c) {
    for (Iterator<?> it = c.iterator(); it.hasNext(); )
        if (!cond(it.next()))
            it.remove();
}
```
`cond` is a function with signature `bool(final T)`;
- Aggregate Operations


##Streams
Since Java 8 all `Collections` provides support for **streams**.
A stream is simply a **sequence** of elements. Stream's element are not stored anywhere (a stream is not a data structure). Think about them as flux of data on which you can perform a number of **pipelined** operations. 
![](images/stream.jpg )


For instance here is how to write the filter we have seen before using streams. 
```java
al= al.stream()
	.filter(element -> element>=5)
	.collect(Collectors.toList());

}
```
This shows how to **pipeline** multiple operations.
```java
		al= al.stream()
				.filter(element -> element>=5)
				.map(element -> element*7)
				.map(e -> e> 70 ? e%70 : e )
				.collect(Collectors.toList());

```

Note that filter-map is a very common patter! Whenever possible use **streams** because they end up in better code quality and ofter in increased performance because of the capability of parallel processing of streams.

Streams allows **reduction** to be performed very elegantly. Imagine you want to find the sum of a List. Using streams we will have something like:
```java
		Integer sumal = al.stream()
		.reduce(0, (a,b)->a+b);
```
reduce is a very powerful patter. It Allows to *reduce* a Collection to a another *type* using a *binary operation*.


#Set Interface

>Set is a Collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. It models the mathematical set abstraction. The Set interface contains only methods inherited from Collection and adds the restriction that duplicate elements are prohibited. Set also adds a stronger contract on the behavior of the equals and hashCode operations, allowing Set instances to be compared meaningfully even if their implementation types differ. Two Set instances are equal if they contain the same elements.


Java provides three implementation of Sets.
- TreeSet (Red Black Tree - 2-balanced binary Search Tree)
- HashSet (Hash Table)
- LinkedHashSet. HashSet

Imagine for a second you want to filter duplicate elements from a Collection. Using `Set` and stream:
```java
Set noduplicates= collection.stream().
collect(Collectors.toSet());
```

#Queue

Besides basic Collection operations, queues provide additional insertion, removal, and inspection operations. 

```java
public interface Queue<E> extends Collection<E> {
    E element();
    boolean offer(E e);
    E peek();
    E poll();
    E remove();
}
```

A common Queue variant is the `PriorityQueue` which removes elements in a sorted manner. Elements with higher priority first.

As an example we will show how to `sort` a Collection of Integers.

```java
List<Integer> al = new ArrayList<>();

		for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
			al.add(i);
al= al.stream()
		.filter(element -> element>=5)
		.map(element -> element*7)
		.map(e -> e> 70 ? e%70 : e )
		.collect(Collectors.toList());
		System.out.println(al);

		Queue<Integer> queue = new PriorityQueue(al);
		al.clear();
		  while (!queue.isEmpty())
		      al.add(queue.remove());

		  System.out.println(al);
```

**Note** that this sorting method has a name and is called **heap sort**. 
When the priority queue is implemented using a `log(n)` access data structure **heap sort** has optimal complexity `nlog(n)`.


#Map 
>A Map is an object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys: Each key can map to at most one value. It models the mathematical function abstraction. The Map interface includes methods for basic operations (such as put, get, remove, containsKey, containsValue, size, and empty), bulk operations (such as putAll and clear), and collection views (such as keySet, entrySet, and values).



#Stream Part 2
Stream in Java bring **functional programming** into Java.
Functional programming is **different** from imperative programming. 

- Computation is **function evaluation** and is not **state manipulation**! This is a HUGE difference

```c++
unsigned int sum=0;
for(int i=0;i<100;i++){
	sum+=i;
}
```
vs

```haskell
sum[1..100]
```
For those interested in Functional Programming I suggest to read more about Haskell (which is one of the most popular FP languages out there). For a computer science it is mandatory to know more about this. 

Read here:
[http://learnyouahaskell.com/](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) 

Functional programming is hevily based on a pretty abstract and new branch of mathematics named **category theory**. One of the concept in this theory is the `Monad`.
A Monad represent a computation a a series of steps and the semantic of chaining operations that operates on the monad itself together.

- You don't need any knowledge of **category theory** at all to put `java streams` in full use.

Streams can be created from `Collections` easily using the `stream()` method exposed by the `Collection` interface.
Stream can be also created from regular objects using the `static` method from `Stream`.

Consider the following:
```java
int a,b,c;
//init abc
Stream.of(a,b,c)
.average()
.ifPresent(System.out::println);  
```

`Stream` is a stream of `Object` (java class `Object`) but there are many specialization of `stream` for different types.

`IntStream` for instance is a stream made for working with integers.

```java
IntStream.range(1, 4)
    .forEach(System.out::println);
```

Specialized streams works as normal stream but they also expose specialized methods (`IntStream` provides `sum()` for instance).

##Streams are lazy
It means that any stream operations is really performed only when the result of the operation is required.
Consider the following:
```java
Stream.of("d2", "a2", "b1", "b3", "c")
    .filter(s -> {
        System.out.println("filter: " + s);
        return true;
    });
```
When executed this code does not print anything at all on the console simply because the stream is never required to be printed on the console! This mean also that filtering operation does not really take place at all unless some of the values of the stream are used at later time in the program.


##Stream order of processing
```java
IntStream.range(1, 10)
	    .filter(s -> {
	    	if(s>5){
	        System.out.println(s+ " is good");
	        return true;
	    	}
	    	else
	    		System.out.println(s+ " isn't good");
	        return false;
	    })
	    .forEach(s -> System.out.println("forEach: " + s));
```
produces

```
1 isn't good
2 isn't good
3 isn't good
4 isn't good
5 isn't good
6 is good
forEach: 6
7 is good
forEach: 7
8 is good
forEach: 8
9 is good
forEach: 9
```

Elements are processed vertially. It means that a single element is completly processed before moving to the next one.

Why is that? Because this can actually reduce the number of performed operation in some case:

```java
IntStream.range(1, 100)
	    .filter(s -> {
	    	if(s>5){
	        System.out.println(s+ " is good");
	        return true;
	    	}
	    	else
	    		System.out.println(s+ " isn't good");
	        return false;
	    })
	    .map(e -> {return e*e;})
	    .anyMatch(e -> {
	    	System.out.println("match"+e);
	    	return e>36;
	    });
```

```java
1 isn't good
2 isn't good
3 isn't good
4 isn't good
5 isn't good
6 is good
match36
7 is good
match49
```
**Elements from 1 to 99 are not processed at all!**

Some operations can't processe element withouth processing the others! Think about sorting for instance. You can't sort a stream withouth looking at all elements of the stream.
For those kind of operation the order of execution is horizontal.

##Stream cannot be reused. 
One you create a stream any attempt in reusing it will raise an exception! `IllegalStateException`. 

```java
Stream<String> stream =
    Stream.of("d2", "a2", "b1", "b3", "c")
        .filter(s -> s.startsWith("a"));

stream.anyMatch(s -> true);    // ok
stream.noneMatch(s -> true);   // exception. 2nd use!
```

In order to  avoid setting up the same stream more than once you can use a `Supplier<Stream>` . It exposes a `get()` function which creates a brand new stream (and already setted up) for use.
```java

Supplier<Stream<String>> streamSupplier =
    () -> Stream.of("d2", "a2", "b1", "b3", "c")
            .filter(s -> s.startsWith("a"));

streamSupplier.get().anyMatch(s -> true);   // ok
streamSupplier.get().noneMatch(s -> true);  // ok
```
